## Description
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. The user has 5 lives to guess the word generated by the computer and is told whether or not the guesses they are making are correct or not with a running total of remaining lives when a wrong guess is made.

- The motivation of the project was to create an interactive game for users to engage with using python commands and moving work from a local repo to GitHub and vice versa.
- I have learned a lot about the use of commits and how important they are at each stage of the project to be able to identify potential flaws in code that may affect future code development.
