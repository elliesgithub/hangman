## Description
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

- This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. The user has 5 lives to guess the word generated by the computer and is told whether or not the guesses they are making are correct or not with a running total of remaining lives when a wrong guess is made.
- The motivation of the project was to create an interactive game for users to engage with using ***python*** and **moving work from a local repo to GitHub and vice versa**.
- I have learned a lot about the ***use of commits*** and how important they are at each stage of the project to be able to identify potential flaws in code that may affect future code development. I also developed my knowledge on ***the use of classes*** and using ***functions*** and ***methods*** within them.

## Installation instructions

Clone this repository into a terminal using the below command:
```
git clone https://github.com/elliesgithub/hangman.git

Continue to run the hangman game following the instructions given.

## Usage instructions

- A random word is selected from the word_list.
- The user inputs a singular letter as a guess.
- A response is given as to whether the guess was correct, incorrect, already guessedor invalid.
- The user has 5 lives and the game will run until they have either guessed all letters of the word or lives have run out.
